 perform normalization (save modified mp3 or PCM to check?)
 don't process silent (low vol) parts
 handle extreme values (short samples e.g.)
 handle end of the buffer (or discard it?)
 export data in some format (series of freqDHist batches? e.g. ~5sec length) + mark style
 scan specified folder and handle all mp3 there
 test compatibility with diff. formats of mp3
 rewrite using stream API
