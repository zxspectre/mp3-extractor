 perform normalization (save modified mp3 or PCM to check?)
 don't process silent (low vol) parts
 handle extreme values (short samples e.g.)
 export data in some format (series of freqDHist batches? e.g. ~5sec length) + mark style
 scan specified folder and handle all mp3 there
 test compatibility with diff. formats of mp3
 extract vector every 1/16th at 120 bpm, but take fft batch of at least 4096 (if it can't  be done - use sliding window or ignore mp3)
 currently DbConversion is performed on each channel, then averaging is being made to get 1 Histogram. Consider other choices (export stereo histogram-unlikely, perform averaging first, toDb - last)
 double seems to slow program a bit - check float

Resolved:
 handle end of the buffer (or discard it?)
 rewrite using stream API (doesn't seem to improve much)
